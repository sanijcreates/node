If you add a scripts of your own in package.json, you can use it however you want. 


  "scripts": {
    "start": "node app.js"
  },

  if i run "npm start" it will run the app.js. 
  Similarly you can customize it to run a specific file.  


  ## Uninstalling a package?

  running the command, npm uninstall <package name>

ALTERNATIVE WAY,
  removing node modules file, removing package-lock.json file, and remove the specific dependency you want to remove from the pacage.json 
  and, run command npm install
