to run nodemon add a dev scripts in the packaage.json file. 

"dev" : "nodemon app.js"

and when you run npm run dev in the terminal, it will run nodemon

what is so interesting about node mon?

while using just node, you would have to restart your server everytime you change something in the app. 
but, when using nodemon, it automatically restarts your server and shows the changes. 

you can customize the scripts any way you want. 

you can even run nodemon in the start scripts, 

"start" : "nodemon app.js"
